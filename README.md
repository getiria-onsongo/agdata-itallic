# ITALLIC: A tool for automatically identifying and correcting errors in location based plant breeding data

One of the challenges of integrating plant breeding data to collectively analyze it with other sources of 
data such as genotype, environment, management, and socioeconomic data is errors in location data. Collectively, 
this data could be used to inform genetic predictive models for maize, wheat, and other crops. Typical errors in
plant breeding location data include flipped latitude and longitude values, missing negative signs, and, in some 
cases, missing data. This tool, an **I**ntegrated **T**ool for **A**utomatic **L**at **L**ong **I**mputation 
and **C**leaning (ITALLIC), automatically detects and corrects errors in location data and imputes missing values 
for location-dependent data, such as region name.
